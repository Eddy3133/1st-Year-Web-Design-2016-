        <blockquote><a name="My First Webpage!"></a>
            <p>Growing<em> up in</em> a Nigerian  home with a lovely family of six  and a good support system has structured me to the young man i am today. My name is Edirinverere Okpikpi, i am the first of four children , i love spending time with my <br> family and i love them very much. I hail from delta state which is in the southern part of Nigeri</br> a.</blockquote>
    I will say that i had a pretty much basic childhood. I grew up in the capital of my country(Abuja) and i have lots of good and bad memories about it.I completed my elementary school and later on graduated from stella maris college (which is a high school in abuja). After the completion of my high school i was looking for universities to attend, <a id="bookmark">then one of</a> my friends told me about coming to school in canada<p></p> and my first reaction to that was it'll be to expensive but God saw me through and i came to study in canada. Initially my aim was to study civil engineering in the university of manitoba but as it turns out i ended up studying applied computer science, at first i didn't really know anything about it but i'm getting used to it and i love it now to be honest. This is the first time i'm actually leaving my country, i remember how excited i felt and frankly <em>higibt</em>speaking i was afraid travelling alone... i remember i almost missed my flight from Amsterdam<br></br> to calgary because i fell asleep amd lost track of time because i was so exhausted from my trip from Lagos to Amsterdam. It was six a six hour flight and  the longest time i had ever been on a plane in my life and i was'nt ready to go for another round of travelling and forcing my self to watch movies before on the plane. Thank God i arrieved safely.</p>

    <p><blockquote>I'm currently in the university right now, facing my books and living with a wonderful set of nigerians, we are eight as a whole. They're are very good people, annoying most of the time but they have really implanted good attributes in me already and this is just my third week in canada.</blockquote>
    Well, coming to Canada has really changed my perspective of things. This cold is the one thing that will want to make me to go back to my country, it was'nt as bad as it was befor tho, i'm still adapting> When i came to school here i thoght it would be easy, just like this assignment im doing very very stressful but hey! nothing good comes easy and my reality right now is just to face my books and make my parents proud. </p>

Well, from the way things are going i will end up being a computer scientist, i really wish i will have one awesome breakthrough like bill gates but if wishes where horses beggers would ride, that is why i'm going to(by GOd's grace) work hard and archieve my heart desire and i hope to design better webpages in the future, way better than this, please dont judge me, it my first website.
